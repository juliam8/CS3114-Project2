Given a sequence, simply searching a list of sequence strings for one that matches would take a long time for a large collection of sequences. Instead, we will use a tree structure to store sequences in a way that allows for efficient search. Not only can we determine whether a specified sequence is in the database, but we can also find any sequence in the database that matches a search prefix.
